            Hi, I'm Carmine Anderson-Falconi, a dedicated student pursuing Computer Science and Data Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My academic journey is fueled by a passion for leveraging technology to solve meaningful problems and enrich lives.
            </p>
            <p>
            Alongside my coursework, I’m an active member of UNC’s Eta chapter of 
            <strong>Kappa Theta Pi</strong>, the university’s first co-ed professional technology organization dedicated to fostering professional, social, and technical development among members. 
            You can learn more about our chapter at 
            <a href="https://www.ktpunc.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ktpunc.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            In my role as <strong>New Member Education Director</strong>, I guide new inductees through their initiation into KTP—helping them build technical confidence, develop community bonds, and integrate into our chapter culture.
            </p>
            <p>
            Through Kappa Theta Pi, I’ve contributed to initiatives around professional development such as resume workshops, interview prep, alumni networking, and collaborative projects. 
            I’ve also helped organize technical advancement workshops and social events, which strengthen our community while empowering members to grow as leaders in tech.
            </p>
            <p>
            At UNC-CH, I remain deeply committed to building a blend of technological expertise, meaningful human connection, and leadership that supports both individual growth and collective success.
            </p>
